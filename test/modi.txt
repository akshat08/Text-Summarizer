Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a direct attack at the Congress, saying the party has never tried to develop the nation. Narendra Modi, who is being viewed as a likely contender for the prime ministerial post from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), slammed the central government, as well as the Nehru-Gandhi family in his speech at the national council meeting of the party here. "The country is sinking, the poor are under the burden of price rise, and we cannot even feel if there is a government at the centre or not," Modi said. "The Congress has ruled the country for several decades. At that time there was no opposition, the media was not so strong, there were not so many activists, but what did they do?" "At that time many countries were trying to rise. India, despite of having all possibilities, lagged behind. Why? Because they never wanted the country to develop," Modi said. Without naming any one, he launched a direct attack at the Nehru-Gandhi family: "Sacrificing the national interest for the interest of one family is the tradition of the Congress," he said. Modi also heaped praise on President Pranab Mukherjee, and said he was sidelined so that the "family" is not affected. "The Congress has spread like termites in the country; it is very difficult to get rid of termites. Only one medicine would work, and that is the sweat of the worker of the BJP," Modi said.
