Without naming Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he said the Congress appointed a "night watchman" to keep the seat warm for the first family of the Congress.

"They did not realise that the night will be so long and dark. As a buffer, they appointed an economist to the post," he said.

Modi's address stood out in sharp contrast to that of his Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh counterparts Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Raman Singh. While the two chief ministers stuck to highlighting achievements of their governments, Modi dwelled on national issues.

The Talkatora Indoor Stadium was jam-packed when Modi delivered his speech.

Modi said that though Pranab Mukherjee was more deserving, the Congress did not make him the prime minister and chose Manmohan Singh. "They realised that if Pranab Mukherjee is successful then what will happen to the (Gandhi) family."

The Gujarat chief minister also criticised the National Advisory Council, headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, as one which is filled with people belonging to the "five-star" culture and having "total disconnect" with the people.

Modi, who may be given a prominent role in national politics by the BJP later this month by inducting him into the Parliamentary Board of the party, said it is a very big challenge and a matter of concern that the UPA government is there at the Centre.

"There is no feeling of whether there is a government or not. It is not in the Congress character or in their blood to do something for the nation," he alleged.
